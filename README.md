# abap_changelog
Abap Changelog project

## Purpose
Main goal of this project was to create a changelog function usable by user without access to any other transaction codes (as se16n or other DDIC tables).
To do so, a simple program allowing user to manager customer's data was created. Changelog is showing changes made by user while managing customer's data via this program.
